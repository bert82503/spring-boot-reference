[[boot-features-spring-application]]
== SpringApplication
The `SpringApplication` class provides a convenient way to bootstrap a Spring application
that will be started from a `main()` method. In many situations you can just delegate to
the static `SpringApplication.run` method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(MySpringConfiguration.class, args);
	}
----

When your application starts you should see something similar to the following:

[indent=0,subs="attributes"]
----

 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \

----

By default `INFO` logging messages will be shown, including some relevant startup details
such as the user that launched the application.



[boot-features-startup-failure]
=== Startup failure
If your application fails to start, registered `FailureAnalyzers` get a chance to provide
a dedicated error message and a concrete action to fix the problem. For instance if you
start a web application on port `8080` and that port is already in use, you should see
something similar to the following:

[indent=0]
----
	***************************
	APPLICATION FAILED TO START
	***************************

	Description:

	Embedded servlet container failed to start. Port 8080 was already in use.

	Action:

	Identify and stop the process that's listening on port 8080 or configure this application to listen on another port.
----

NOTE: Spring Boot provides numerous `FailureAnalyzer` implementations and you can
<<howto.adoc#howto-failure-analyzer,add your own>> very easily.

If no failure analyzers are able to handle the exception, you can still display the full
auto-configuration report to better understand what went wrong. To do so you need to
<<boot-features-external-config,enable the `debug` property>> or
<<boot-features-custom-log-levels,enable `DEBUG` logging>> for
`org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.logging.AutoConfigurationReportLoggingInitializer`.

For instance, if you are running your application using `java -jar` you can enable the
`debug` property as follows:

[indent=0,subs="attributes"]
----
	$ java -jar myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --debug
----



[[boot-features-banner]]
=== Customizing the Banner
The banner that is printed on start up can be changed by adding a `banner.txt` file
to your classpath, or by setting `banner.location` to the location of such a file.
If the file has an unusual encoding you can set `banner.charset` (default is `UTF-8`).
In addition to a text file, you can also add a `banner.gif`, `banner.jpg` or `banner.png`
image file to your classpath, or set a `banner.image.location` property. Images will be
converted into an ASCII art representation and printed above any text banner.

Inside your `banner.txt` file you can use any of the following placeholders:

.Banner variables
|===
| Variable | Description

|`${application.version}`
|The version number of your application as declared in `MANIFEST.MF`. For example
`Implementation-Version: 1.0` is printed as `1.0`.

|`${application.formatted-version}`
|The version number of your application as declared in `MANIFEST.MF` formatted for
display (surrounded with brackets and prefixed with `v`). For example `(v1.0)`.

|`${spring-boot.version}`
|The Spring Boot version that you are using. For example `{spring-boot-version}`.

|`${spring-boot.formatted-version}`
|The Spring Boot version that you are using formatted for display (surrounded with
brackets and prefixed with `v`). For example `(v{spring-boot-version})`.

|`${Ansi.NAME}` (or `${AnsiColor.NAME}`, `${AnsiBackground.NAME}`, `${AnsiStyle.NAME}`)
|Where `NAME` is the name of an ANSI escape code. See
{sc-spring-boot}/ansi/AnsiPropertySource.{sc-ext}[`AnsiPropertySource`] for details.

|`${application.title}`
|The title of your application as declared in `MANIFEST.MF`. For example
`Implementation-Title: MyApp` is printed as `MyApp`.
|===

TIP: The `SpringApplication.setBanner(...)` method can be used if you want to generate
a banner programmatically. Use the `org.springframework.boot.Banner` interface and
implement your own `printBanner()` method.

You can also use the `spring.main.banner-mode` property to determine if the banner has
to be printed on `System.out` (`console`), using the configured logger (`log`) or not
at all (`off`).

The printed banner will be registered as a singleton bean under the name
`springBootBanner`.

[NOTE]
====
YAML maps `off` to `false` so make sure to add quotes if you want to disable the
banner in your application.

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
	spring:
		main:
			banner-mode: "off"
----
====

[[boot-features-customizing-spring-application]]
=== Customizing SpringApplication
If the `SpringApplication` defaults aren't to your taste you can instead create a local
instance and customize it. For example, to turn off the banner you would write:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication app = new SpringApplication(MySpringConfiguration.class);
		app.setBannerMode(Banner.Mode.OFF);
		app.run(args);
	}
----

NOTE: The constructor arguments passed to `SpringApplication` are configuration sources
for spring beans. In most cases these will be references to `@Configuration` classes, but
they could also be references to XML configuration or to packages that should be scanned.

It is also possible to configure the `SpringApplication` using an `application.properties`
file. See _<<boot-features-external-config>>_ for details.

For a complete list of the configuration options, see the
{dc-spring-boot}/SpringApplication.{dc-ext}[`SpringApplication` Javadoc].



[[boot-features-fluent-builder-api]]
=== Fluent builder API
If you need to build an `ApplicationContext` hierarchy (multiple contexts with a
parent/child relationship), or if you just prefer using a '`fluent`' builder API, you
can use the `SpringApplicationBuilder`.

The `SpringApplicationBuilder` allows you to chain together multiple method calls, and
includes `parent` and `child` methods that allow you to create a hierarchy.

For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{code-examples}/builder/SpringApplicationBuilderExample.java[tag=hierarchy]
----

NOTE: There are some restrictions when creating an `ApplicationContext` hierarchy, e.g.
Web components *must* be contained within the child context, and the same `Environment`
will be used for both parent and child contexts. See the
{dc-spring-boot}/builder/SpringApplicationBuilder.{dc-ext}[`SpringApplicationBuilder`
Javadoc] for full details.



[[boot-features-application-events-and-listeners]]
=== Application events and listeners/应用事件和监听器
In addition to the usual Spring Framework events, such as
{spring-javadoc}/context/event/ContextRefreshedEvent.{dc-ext}[`ContextRefreshedEvent`],
a `SpringApplication` sends some additional application events.

[NOTE]
====
Some events are actually triggered before the `ApplicationContext` is created so you
cannot register a listener on those as a `@Bean`. You can register them via the
`SpringApplication.addListeners(...)` or `SpringApplicationBuilder.listeners(...)`
methods.

If you want those listeners to be registered automatically regardless of the way the
application is created you can add a `META-INF/spring.factories` file to your project
and reference your listener(s) using the `org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener`
key.

[indent=0]
----
	org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener=com.example.project.MyListener
----

====

Application events are sent in the following order, as your application runs:

. An `ApplicationStartingEvent` is sent at the start of a run, but before any
  processing except the registration of listeners and initializers.
. An `ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent` is sent when the `Environment` to be used in
  the context is known, but before the context is created.
. An `ApplicationPreparedEvent` is sent just before the refresh is started, but after bean
  definitions have been loaded.
. An `ApplicationReadyEvent` is sent after the refresh and any related callbacks have
  been processed to indicate the application is ready to service requests.
. An `ApplicationFailedEvent` is sent if there is an exception on startup.

当你的应用程序运行时，应用事件按以下顺序发送：

* `ApplicationStartingEvent`：在应用程序运行开始时，但在任何处理之前，除监听器和初始化器注册之外。
* `ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent`：用于应用上下文的环境(`Environment`)已准备，但在创建上下文之前。
* `ApplicationPreparedEvent`：在上下文刷新开始之前，但在组件定义已加载之后。
* `ApplicationReadyEvent`：在上下文刷新和任何关联的回调已处理之后，表示应用程序可以服务请求。
* `ApplicationFailedEvent`：在启动时出现了异常。

TIP: You often won't need to use application events, but it can be handy to know that they
exist. Internally, Spring Boot uses events to handle a variety of tasks.



[[boot-features-web-environment]]
=== Web environment
A `SpringApplication` will attempt to create the right type of `ApplicationContext` on
your behalf. By default, an `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` or
`AnnotationConfigEmbeddedWebApplicationContext` will be used, depending on whether you
are developing a web application or not.

The algorithm used to determine a '`web environment`' is fairly simplistic (based on the
presence of a few classes). You can use `setWebEnvironment(boolean webEnvironment)` if
you need to override the default.

It is also possible to take complete control of the `ApplicationContext` type that will
be used by calling `setApplicationContextClass(...)`.

TIP: It is often desirable to call `setWebEnvironment(false)` when using
`SpringApplication` within a JUnit test.



[[boot-features-application-arguments]]
=== Accessing application arguments
If you need to access the application arguments that were passed to
`SpringApplication.run(...)` you can inject a
`org.springframework.boot.ApplicationArguments` bean. The `ApplicationArguments` interface
provides access to both the raw `String[]` arguments as well as parsed `option` and
`non-option` arguments:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.springframework.boot.*
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*
	import org.springframework.stereotype.*

	@Component
	public class MyBean {

		@Autowired
		public MyBean(ApplicationArguments args) {
			boolean debug = args.containsOption("debug");
			List<String> files = args.getNonOptionArgs();
			// if run with "--debug logfile.txt" debug=true, files=["logfile.txt"]
		}

	}
----

TIP: Spring Boot will also register a `CommandLinePropertySource` with the Spring
`Environment`. This allows you to also inject single application arguments using the
`@Value` annotation.



[[boot-features-command-line-runner]]
=== Using the ApplicationRunner or CommandLineRunner
If you need to run some specific code once the `SpringApplication` has started, you can
implement the `ApplicationRunner` or `CommandLineRunner` interfaces. Both interfaces work
in the same way and offer a single `run` method which will be called just before
`SpringApplication.run(...)` completes.

The `CommandLineRunner` interfaces provides access to application arguments as a simple
string array, whereas the `ApplicationRunner` uses the `ApplicationArguments` interface
discussed above.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.springframework.boot.*
	import org.springframework.stereotype.*

	@Component
	public class MyBean implements CommandLineRunner {

		public void run(String... args) {
			// Do something...
		}

	}
----

You can additionally implement the `org.springframework.core.Ordered` interface or use the
`org.springframework.core.annotation.Order` annotation if several `CommandLineRunner` or
`ApplicationRunner` beans are defined that must be called in a specific order.



[[boot-features-application-exit]]
=== Application exit
Each `SpringApplication` will register a shutdown hook with the JVM to ensure that the
`ApplicationContext` is closed gracefully on exit. All the standard Spring lifecycle
callbacks (such as the `DisposableBean` interface, or the `@PreDestroy` annotation) can
be used.

In addition, beans may implement the `org.springframework.boot.ExitCodeGenerator`
interface if they wish to return a specific exit code when the application ends.



[[boot-features-application-admin]]
=== Admin features
It is possible to enable admin-related features for the application by specifying the
`spring.application.admin.enabled` property. This exposes the
{sc-spring-boot}/admin/SpringApplicationAdminMXBean.{sc-ext}[`SpringApplicationAdminMXBean`]
on the platform `MBeanServer`. You could use this feature to administer your Spring Boot
application remotely. This could also be useful for any service wrapper implementation.

TIP: If you want to know on which HTTP port the application is running, get the property
with key `local.server.port`.

NOTE: Take care when enabling this feature as the MBean exposes a method to shutdown the
application.
